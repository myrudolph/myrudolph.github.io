Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Washington University in St. Louis under the supervision of [Franciso Buera](https://sites.google.com/site/fjbuera/home) and [Ana Maria Santacreu](https://www.anamariasantacreu.com/). 

My research interests lie within the intersection of international trade, innovation, macroeconomics, and development.

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Economics and Information System (with a minor in Mathematics) from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022, and was featured in the [promotion video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy01loj6cLo) for ECON major.
